// The strings the engine puts on the wire: metric label values, log fields, and the facts the nonce
// ledger classifies on. They are a contract with everything downstream -- a dashboard query, an alert,
// a stored counter -- so they are declared here once and referenced by name. Renaming a constant breaks
// the build; editing its value silently moves the wire string under every panel that reads it.
