# `config` — the immutable snapshot

Everything the gateway's behaviour depends on, in one value that is never mutated.

## What it owns

- **`Build`** — merges three layers in a fixed order: defaults, then environment, then the operator's stored overrides. It clones every map and slice it takes from its inputs, so nothing it returns shares memory with its sources.
- **`Defaults`** — the single source of every default value.
- **`Validate`** — fail-fast checks at startup; an unsafe combination is refused rather than discovered later.
- **`Holder`** — an atomic holder that publishes a whole replacement snapshot and notifies subscribers. Readers take a pointer and are never torn.

## Boundaries worth knowing

- **A snapshot is never mutated after `Build`.** Reconfiguration swaps the whole thing.
- **Defaults live here, never in [`env`](../env/).** A `nil` from the environment means "unset", which is not the same as a zero.
- **Zero is meaningful for several limits** — usually "unlimited". That is documented per field, because a zero that silently means something else is how a configuration lies.

## What each group holds

| Group | What it configures, and what a zero means |
| --- | --- |
| `Server` | the listener itself. `StorageDir` is resolved by `main` *before* `Build`, so its `~/.cache/gonka-gateway` default lives there, not in `Defaults`. |
| `Chain` | `GRPCEndpoint` is what the escrow bridge dials. `common/chain` derives the CometBFT RPC host from it at the standard port, and that derived endpoint is the query fallback every escrow read inherits — a deployment that moved the RPC port must set `RPCEndpoint` explicitly. |
| `Tx` | fee, gas and the poll loop that waits for a transaction. |
| `Limits` | admission tuning. A zero `MaxInputTokensInFlight` is unlimited. `MaxTokensCap` bounds what a client may *ask for* and deliberately does not clamp `DefaultMaxTokens`. `ModelAccess` maps a model to one of the tiers below. |
| `Limits.Concurrency` | a zero `MaxRequests` is no static cap at all, leaving admission to the capacity-scaled per-weight limit alone. |
| `Limits.ModelLimits` | the per-model override set. The two token fields are required as a pair; the pointer fields are optional, and a `nil` inherits the global limit rather than meaning zero. |
| `Modes` | PoC mode and the disabled/redirect switches. |
| `Rotation` | escrow rotation, its settlement switch, and how far before PoC it runs. |
| `Cache` | the response cache's byte ceiling. |
| `Accounting` | the per-request ledger, bounded on both axes; neither bound may be zero. |
| `NonceAccounting` | the per-nonce ledger, which answers a different question than `Accounting`: where every committed nonce went, rather than what became of one client request. It reaches an operator as `devshard_gateway_nonces_*` on the gateway's own metrics endpoint. `RetentionEpochs` of 0 keeps every epoch. |
| `Capture` | the request-capture sink. An empty `Dir` means `<storageDir>/captured-requests`, `SampleRate` runs from 1 (every matching request) to 0 (none), and `MaxBytes` ceilings what the directory may hold. |
| `Stream` | the drain timeout and the three-tier classification byte budget. |
| `Perf` | Envoy-style host ejection: consecutive-fail and rate-with-min-volume triggers, timed backoff, and the pool-wide ejection cap. `MinAvailableHosts` is a floor kept routable regardless of that cap, and host-model state unseen for `HostStalenessSeconds` is evicted. |
| `Engine` | race-escalation tuning. A zero `MaxSpeculativeAttempts` is bounded only by the host group, and the backstops this struct does not carry are engine constants — see [`docs/race.md`](../docs/race.md), "Tunables and backstops". |
| `Scheduler` | `MatchWaitMS` is how long a bound nonce waits for a co-arriving compatible request before it is burned; 0 burns immediately. |

Two accessors carry rules of their own. `Server.AdminEnabled` is what callers must gate on — comparing a presented credential against `AdminAPIKey` directly would authenticate an empty one. `Limits.AccessFor` resolves a model outside a *populated* `ModelAccess` to admin-only rather than open; with no map at all every model is open. See [`docs/operations.md`](../docs/operations.md), "Who may call what".

## The combinations `Validate` refuses

Most checks are ordinary range bounds. These are the ones that exist because a legal-looking pair is unsafe:

- `admin_api_key` must be at least 16 characters when set. A key short enough to guess is worse than none, because "none" disables admin entirely while a weak one authenticates.
- `api_keys` must be non-empty once any `model_access` entry is `api_key`, or that model is configured to be unreachable.
- `host_cutoff_max_ms` must not exceed `perf_ejection_max_seconds`, so [`perf`](../perf/) stays the dominant ejection authority rather than the per-host cutoff.
- `engine_loser_grace_ms` must be at least `engine_inter_chunk_stall_ms`. A loser is cancelled at the grace, so a grace under the stall window kills attempts that are merely between chunks — before the gateway would even call such a stream stalled.
- `scheduler_match_wait_ms` is capped at 5000. A long grace parks a committed-cost nonce on the chance of a co-arrival, so the ceiling is a budget guard, not a taste judgement.
- `chain_grpc` is checked as `host:port`, not as a URL: a gRPC target carries no scheme, so a URL check would pass anything.

Every problem is collected and reported together, and the field names in the messages use the snake_case admin-API spelling rather than the Go one.

## Using the `Holder`

Readers call `Load` on every use and get a shared, immutable pointer. Reconfiguration calls `Swap`, which publishes the whole replacement and then notifies subscribers **synchronously and in no particular order** — so a subscriber must be fast, must be order-independent, and must never call `Swap` itself.

`Overrides` is the admin-tunable subset that the store persists and `Build` merges over the environment layer; a nil field means "not overridden". `ParseOverrides` rejects unknown fields, because a typo in an admin `PUT` must be reported rather than silently ignored.
