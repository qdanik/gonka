// Test flow:
//  1. Build a chat prompt sized to fit the host request budget alone but overflow it once the escrow's catch-up reserve is added.
//  2. Send the chat completion request through the harness.
//  3. Assert the fixture prompt does not already exceed the host budget by itself.
//  4. Assert the response is refused with 413.
//  5. Assert no limiter slot was acquired, since the refusal must happen before admission.
