# `nonces` — what feeds the ledger

[`accounting`](../accounting/) is a book of facts. This package is the only thing that writes to it.

## What it owns

- **`Recorder`** — opened by `Open` when nonce accounting is enabled, `nil` when it is not, so a disabled ledger costs nothing and every call site tolerates the nil.
- **Three live sources**, each delivered by the [`journal`](../journal/)'s consumer rather than on the producer's goroutine. The race, through `RecordRace`; the scheduler's burns, through `RecordGhost`; the timeout votes, through `RecordTimeout`.
- **Two chain sources.** A per-escrow diff watcher that hands every composed diff to the [`journal`](../journal/), which reads its validation verdicts and applied timeouts under the session lock and applies them later through `RecordDiffFacts`; and a periodic sweep that reconciles finished nonces, host stats and open challenges with what the chain actually holds.
- **The warmup probe's settlement**, through `RecordProbe`, delivered by the journal. When the book refuses the probe, `RecordProbe` returns the refusal and the journal writes `escrow warmup could not settle its nonce`: only the book can see it.
- **The HTTP listener** that serves the book it owns as JSON, built whenever the ledger is enabled.

## What it does not own

It does not classify. Which counter a nonce lands in is `accounting`'s decision; this package only reports what happened, in the vocabulary the ledger admits.

## Boundaries

- **A disabled ledger is a nil `*Recorder`, not a no-op object.** Every method tolerates a nil receiver, which is what keeps the enabled and disabled paths from diverging.
- **The sweep is the safety net, not the primary path.** Live events are recorded as they happen; the sweep exists because the gateway can miss one — a restart, a dropped diff — and the chain is the authority.
- **The book's lock is never taken under a session's lock.** The diff observer runs under the lock of the session that composed the diff and only appends to the journal. The watcher installs itself only with the journal `Start` receives, which `lifecycle.go` passes from the composed gateway.

## The judgements it does make

Not classification — that is `accounting`'s — but the four readings of a raw fact that have to happen before the fact can be reported at all:

- **The epoch a swept escrow is stamped with is the one the chain stamped on it at creation**, resolved per escrow and memoised, because an escrow's creation epoch never moves (`CreationEpochFunc`, `Recorder.epochOf`). An escrow whose epoch cannot be resolved is not opened at all, so no fact is filed under a guess: a guess is indistinguishable from a fact to everything downstream, and `Book.OpenEscrow` pins the first value it is given for the escrow's life.

  First sighting cannot stand in for creation. The counters are restored from `accounting.db`, so "first seen" is a property of that file rather than of the escrow, and that file is dropped and rebuilt whenever `accounting.SchemaVersion` moves, silently and without an error; it is emptied for one epoch by `POST /v1/admin/accounting/reset/{epoch}`, which deletes live escrows and not only retired ones, and pruned by retention. Meanwhile the chain-side half of every escrow — its latest nonce, its lifetime `HostStats`, its chain cost — is re-read whole on every sweep whatever the ledger remembers. A re-sighted escrow would therefore file its entire history under whatever epoch the gateway happened to be running in.

  The resolver asks the chain, whose `DevshardEscrow.epoch_index` is the authority, and falls back to the epoch this gateway recorded when it created the escrow (`devshards.rotation_epoch`, in a different database that a schema bump does not touch). A refusal is never memoised, so an escrow the chain could not be reached for is stamped on a later sweep rather than never.

  One consequence is worth knowing before using it: resetting an epoch whose escrows are still live now re-populates it on the next sweep, because they are still that epoch's escrows. The route clears what an epoch holds; it does not move an escrow out of the epoch it belongs to.
- **A slow receipt is measured from the dispatch, and only where both stamps exist.** An attempt that never got a receipt is a refusal, which the ledger already counts; calling it slow as well would report one failure twice.
- **Clock drift counts in either direction.** A host running ahead makes the gateway wait past a deadline that already passed; one running behind makes it vote on a nonce still being served.
- **A winner crowned after its client left gets its own terminal.** It still counts as work the host delivered, but it is not an answer anybody read — and without a name of its own, the population where the race outlived its client cannot be found in the ledger at all.
